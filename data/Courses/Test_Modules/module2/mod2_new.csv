text,text,"Hi, welcome to swirl! Today, I'm going to teach you how to create a new variable in R. Then I'll show you how to store some numbers in a vector and find the mean of those numbers.",,,,,,Simple output to user
text,text,"To create a new variable in R, use the assignment operator, which looks like an arrow: <-.  For example, if you wanted to assign the value 10 to a new variable called x, you would type x <- 10.",,,,,,
question,cmd_question,Create a new variable that stores the value 20. You can call the variable anything you want as long as the name begins with a letter.,command,,assign; newVar; word=20,"Try num <- 20. Spaces don't matter, although it's good practice to include a space before and after the arrow.",,
text,text,"The syntax for creating a vector of numbers, say 3, 4, and 5, is c(3,4,5). The c() function just 'concatenates', or joins, a group of numbers.",,,,,,
question,cmd_question,Try creating a vector of numbers using the c() function and store it in a variable of your choice.,command,,assign; newVar; useFunc=c,"If you wanted to create a variable z that stores the numbers 6, 9, and 10, you would type z <- c(6,9,10). Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.",,"Should test that the user 1) used the assignment operator, 2) created a new variable, 3) used the c() function. We should be able to capture the name of the new variable for future use."
question,cmd_question,Now compute the mean of these numbers by calling the mean() function on your new vector. Don't worry about storing the result  in a variable.,command,,useFunc=mean; result=mean(newVar),"If you wanted to call the mean function on a variable y, you would type functionName(y). Type ?mean to view the help file for the mean() function.",,"Should test that the user 1) used the mean() function and 2) got the expected result based on our ""behind-the-scenes"" computation of the mean of the user-created variable."
question,mult_question,Which function in R computes the mean of a bunch of numbers?,multiple,median(); mean(); average(),word=mean(),This one should be obvious!,,"Automatically populates multiple choice question with AnswerChoices and specifies ""mean"" as the correct choice."
video,video,"Would you like to view a brief YouTube video on how to compute the mean, median, and mode by hand?",,,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3aKKasOmIw,Should accept yes or no response and open the url (or not) accordingly.
text,text,Great work! Now you know how to create new variables and compute the mean of a bunch of numbers in R.,,,,,,Simple output to user
