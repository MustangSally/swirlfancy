text,"Hi, welcome to swirl! Today, we're going to store some numbers in a vector, then take the mean of those numbers. I'm assuming you've already learned how to create variables and call functions.",,,,,,text,Simple output to user
question,"First, create a vector of numbers using the c() function and store that vector in a variable of your choice.",command,,assign; newVar; useFunc=c,Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.,,cmd_question,"Should test that the user 1) used the assignment operator, 2) created a new variable, 3) used the c() function. We should be able to capture the name of the new variable for future use."
question,Now compute the mean of these numbers by calling the mean() function on your new vector.,command,,useFunc=mean; result=mean(newVar),Type ?mean to view the help file for the mean() function.,,cmd_question,"Should test that the user 1) used the mean() function and 2) got the expected result based on our ""behind-the-scenes"" computation of the mean of the user-created variable."
question,Which function in R computes the mean of a bunch of numbers?,multiple,median(); mean(); average(),word=mean(),This one should be obvious!,,mult_question,"Automatically populates multiple choice question with AnswerChoices and specifies ""mean"" as the correct choice."
video,"Would you like to view a brief YouTube video on how to compute the mean, median, and mode by hand?",,,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3aKKasOmIw,video,Should accept yes or no response and open the url (or not) accordingly.
