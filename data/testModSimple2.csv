"question","First, create a vector of the numbers 2, 3, 6, and 9 using the c() function and store that vector in a variable called nums.","command","","nums <- c(2, 3, 6, 9)","Type ?c to view the help file for the c() function.","","Should test that the user's command matches the command in AnswerTests. Let's remove all whitespace before comparing."
