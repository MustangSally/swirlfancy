==========

Mockup illustrating the use of addTaskCallback for questions with command answer type. Only in this case can the user answer from the R prompt rather than in response to readline() or select.list(). Output types "range" and "exact" *could* be handled from the R prompt, and probably should be, but for clarity and simplicity, here, are not. These and other output and answer types are handled by pared-down versions of swirl 1.0 code.
