demo throwing all the logic in callback
==========

Handling everything from the callback.

The demo is limited to Module 2 of Data Analysis, represented as a csv file with a few manual alterations. Features such as support for multiple users, or tracking user progress are not implemented.

An annotated version of Hadley's frndly.R code is included for reference. To run either, source the relevant file, type "hi()" to begin, "nxt()" to advance, and "bye()" to quit.
